# AgentNet-Chrome-Plugin

Add Chrome Support for AgentNet

### Setup Instruction:

Please use **Goole Chrome Dev** to load the unpacked extension and complete your workflow.

You should download the unpacked extension first:

```

### Developer Notes

8.x.x versions of eslint are no longer supported. You may want to upgrade to 9.x.x soon, but that would require migrating the config from `.eslintrc` to `eslint.config.js` and might have other surprises.
